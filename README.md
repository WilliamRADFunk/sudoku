# Sudoku
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

## Purpose

An Angular 7 library module that builds, checks, and communicates the state of a 3x3 sudoku grid.

This will be a modular piece behind a larger project `Sudoku Extreme`, which will add another dimension to the Sudoku experience.
